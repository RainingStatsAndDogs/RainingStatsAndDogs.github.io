Summary: Free Resources and Lectures

## About
There are some amazing free resources out there for everyone to use and I'll do my best to keep this list up-to-date. This is a WIP so expect lots of updates on this over time. 

## Machine Learning
### General Books
* [**Alpaydim, Ethem**: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://dl.matlabyar.com/siavash/ML/Book/Ethem%20Alpaydin-Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning-The%20MIT%20Press%20(2014).pdf) 
* [**Barber, David**: Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf) - Another of my all-time favorites. It's a fantastic book with excellent exposition.
* [**Bishop, Christopher M.**: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) - And "older" book but very wonderfully put together with a great style to it. I'd highly recommend reading this.
* [**Diesenroth et al.**: Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) - A really great book going through the required math for modern ML (linear algebra, optimization, probability, etc...) with some algorithms discussed. It's a wonderful book and the authors are graciously keeping the book free to access.
* [**Effron & Hastie**: Computer-Age Statistical Inference](https://stat206-winter21-01.courses.soe.ucsc.edu/system/files/attachments/efron-hastie-2016.pdf) - I struggled where this book lived as it covers lots of statistical concepts (e.g. Empirical Bayes, False Discovery Rates) but it _does_ cover more modern ML approaches like tree ensembles and neural networks. What I can say is that this book is one of my all-time favorites and a should be required reading.
* [**Hastie, et al.**: Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) - Probably one of the most famous books on the subject. It can be a bit dense and is somewhat "out-of-date" in that it doesn't have modern takes/algorithms. But it deserves its rightful place in the pantheon and very happy it is freely available.
* [**Hardt & Recht**: Patterns, Predictions and Actions - A Story About Machine Learning](https://mlstory.org/pdf/patterns.pdf) - A newer book but very good with a great narrative. It is more up-to-date (including more modern takes on model complexity plots) and includes great sections on Causality.
* [**James, et al.**: An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) - You can download the pdf of the book from here. It is a more introductory but also more modern in terms of the techniques covered.
* [**Murphy, Kevin**: Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/Murphy_Machine_Learning.pdf) - Truly wonderful book. I enjoyed every section.
* [**Murphy, Kevin**: Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) - I've not yet read this, but have it pre-ordered AND just saw the pre-print is available. It looks as wonderful as the first (and cannot wait to see the NEW book in 2023!!!)
* [**Shalev-Schwartz & Ben-David**: Understanding Machine Learning - From Theory to Algorithms ](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/w~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf) - A more theoretical book that is not for beginners but very good.
* [**Theodoridis & Koutroumbas**: Pattern Recognition](https://darmanto.akakom.ac.id/pengenalanpola/Pattern%20Recognition%204th%20Ed.%20(2009).pdf) - I just discovered this looking for a different book by Theodoridis. It looks similar (which is great) but additional topics. It is older and I've not read it yet.

### Subject Specific Books
* [**Goodfellow et al.**: Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - A really cool resource focussed just on deep learning.
* [**Rasmussen & Williams**: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf) - An amazing book about one of my favorite algorithms! It's short but wonderful. I can't recommend it enough.


### General Lectures
* [**Cornell**: CS 4/5780: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2021fa/) -  One of my all-time favorite series! Prof. Weinberger is brilliant and very funny.  
* [**The Mathematical Monk**: Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA) - Another fantastic introductory series. The speaker genuinely loves the subject and is very impressive as he proves/derives topics on the fly.  
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Statistical Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij2XCvrRzLokX6EoHWaGA2cC) - Pretty much everything from Uni Tübingen is worth a view. This is a bit more technical than the series by _Prof. Weinberger_ or _The Mathematical Monk_, but it is amazing.
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij1tHaOFY96m5uX3J21a6yNd) - Another beautiful series that is well-taught. It requires more background but well worth it!
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij1a6KdEy8PVE9zoCv6SlHRS) - Meant to provide the necessary basics to truly understand Machine Learning, such as Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics and many more topics.  Very well done. 
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij35ShKLDqccJSDntugY4FQT) - Similar in spirit to  _Prof. Weinberger_ and _The Mathematical Monk_. This is designed to get you up to speed and cover many important topics.  

### Subject Specific Lectures
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Deep Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij3NTWIdtMbfvX7Z-4WEXRqD) - This focusses only on deep learning but is fantastic and thorough.
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Data Compression with Probabilistic Deep Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij0Mp1dW2HuXlb-UQIYnv8xK) - To be honest, I've only begun to watch this series but it is good (as with all their content, but it is very intense.)
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij35L2MHGzis8AEHz7mg381_) - Again, very niche but it's amazing. I love this series!
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Self-Driving Cars](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij321zzKXK6XCQXAaaYjQbzr) - I have not seen any of this but it's on my watchlist and I am certain it will be brilliant.

## Probability & Statistics
### General Books
* [**Billingsley, Patrick**: Probability and Measure](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/billingsley.pdf) - One of the best books covering the topic of measure-theoretic probability. It is very technical and I would recommend having a background in Measure Theory before starting this.
* [**DeGroot & Schervish**: Probability and Statistics](http://bio5495.wustl.edu/Probability/Readings/DeGroot4thEdition.pdf) - A great introductory book that starts with a basis in probability before moving into some statistics concepts. Best for those wanting self-study, there is a [solutions manual](http://www.ru.ac.bd/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/03/101_05_DeGroot_Solutions-Manual-for-Probability-and-Statistics-2012.pdf) online.
* [**Dekking et al.**: A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://cis.temple.edu/~latecki/Courses/CIS2033-Spring13/Modern_intro_probability_statistics_Dekking05.pdf) - I've not read this, but perused the topics and it looks very good.
* [**Durrett, Rick**: Probability: Theory and Examples](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf) - A measure-theoretic approach to probability. It's a classic but I wouldn't recommend this as your first book in the subject.
* [**Pishro-Nik, Hossein **:](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/) - Available online with an interactive layout, there are lots of examples and proofs. Great book to starts learning the topics
* [**Resnick, Sidney I.**: A Probability Path](https://www.usb.ac.ir/FileStaff/9145_2018-9-18-12-59-30.pdf) - Written by the wonderful Prof. Resnick, this book also provides a great introduction to measure-theoretic probability. Prof. Resnick's charming personality are on full-dislpay throughout the book. 
* [**Ross, Sheldon**: A First Course in Probability Theory](http://julio.staff.ipb.ac.id/files/2015/02/Ross_8th_ed_English.pdf) - A very accessible text on Probability with lots of exercises and solutions.
* [**Wasserman, Larry**: All of Statistics](http://egrcc.github.io/docs/math/all-of-statistics.pdf) - A fantastic book that covers tons of topics from Probability, Causal Inference, Linear Models and many more. Well-written.


### Subject Specific Books
* [**Bickel & Doksum**: Mathematical Statistics - Basic Ideas and Selected Topics Vol. 1](http://www.mim.ac.mw/books/Mathematical%20statistics,%20basic%20ideas%20and%20selected%20topics%20Vol%201,%20Second%20Edition.pdf) - I'll be honest, I HATE this book. I'm including this because it covers lots of important topics. I personally found the writing poor and scattered and ideas are not well-covered. But I know lots of other universities still use this, so I'm probably in the minority. But _caveat emptor_.
* [**Casella & Berger**: Statistical Inference](https://mybiostats.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/casella-berger.pdf) - This classic covers lots of generic probability methods (pretty much avoiding measure theory) and lots of statistics. It has a [complete solutions manual](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~zhu/ams570/Solutions-Casella-Berger.pdf) which is great for self-study.
* [**Christensen, Ronald**: Plane Answers to Complex Questions](http://barbra-coco.dyndns.org/yuri/plan_answers_to_complex_question.pdf) - Focussed solely on Linear Models, this is a great book that covers Linear Algebra and then dives into a Linear Algebra-based approach to GLM's.
* [**Efron, Bradley**: Large Scale Inference - Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing & Inference](http://213.230.96.51:8090/files/ebooks/Matematika/Efron%20B.%20Large-Scale%20Inference..%20Empirical%20Bayes%20Methods%20for%20Estimation,%20Testing,%20and%20Prediction%20(CUP,%202010)(ISBN%209780521192491)(O)(277s)%20MVsa%20.pdf) - A great book covering Empirical Bayes with lots of fantastic applications.
* [**Gelman et al.**: Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA3)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf) - The Bayesian "Bible"! The principle text written by several amazing professors. It is a bit technical but AMAZING.
* [**Gelman et al.**: Regression and Other Stories](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/01/27/regression-and-other-stories-free-pdf/) - I'm a firm believer that Linear Models are highly powerful when used appropriately, but that is a skill that has been de-emphasized in favor of flashy approaches. This book covers tons of excellent topics, including Causal Inference and Bayesian Approaches. A MUST read.
* [**Koller & Friedman**: Probabilistic Graphical Models - Principles and Techniques](https://djsaunde.github.io/read/books/pdfs/probabilistic%20graphical%20models.pdf) - A fantastic textbook covering PGM's! There is a Coursera course taught by Prof. Koller as well.
* [**McElreath, Richard**: Statistical Rethinking](http://civil.colorado.edu/~balajir/CVEN6833/bayes-resources/RM-StatRethink-Bayes.pdf) - A really great book on Bayesian probability that has a really unique perspective. The author is an evolutionary anthropologist and his perspective was very "fresh" in my opinion. 
* [**Resnick, Sidney I.**: Adventures in Stochastic Processes](https://www.fcfm.buap.mx/jzacarias/cursos/procesos/libros/book3pe.pdf) - Prof. Resnick's other book, this covers the misadventures of _Happy Harry_ as a way to teach Stochastic Processes. Prof. Resnick is a treasure and I can't tell you how much I loved this book. Very accessible and funny. 
* [**Ross, Sheldon**: An Introduction to Probability Models](https://bayanbox.ir/view/7776870545953264619/introduction-to-probability-model-S.Ross-math-cs.blog.ir.pdf) - Another wonderfully accessible book into stochastic models. Covers Poisson Processes, Brownian Motion, Markov Chains, etc... 
* [**Vershynin, Roman**: High Dimensional Probability - An Introdution with Applications in Data Science](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf) - The book focuses exclusively on high-dimensional probability, i.e. $\vec{\mathbf{x}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ where $n$ is very large. This is typically the case in actual DS/ML projects and requires specific results. You need a strong mathematical background for this.
