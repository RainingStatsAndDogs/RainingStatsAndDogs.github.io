Summary: Free Resources and Lectures

## About
There are some amazing free resources out there for everyone to use and I'll do my best to keep this list up-to-date. This is a WIP so expect lots of updates on this over time. 

## Machine Learning
### General Books
* [**Alpaydim, Ethem**: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://dl.matlabyar.com/siavash/ML/Book/Ethem%20Alpaydin-Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning-The%20MIT%20Press%20(2014).pdf) 
* [**Barber, David**: Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf) - Another of my all-time favorites. It's a fantastic book with excellent exposition.
* [**Diesenroth et al.**: Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) - A really great book going through the required math for modern ML (linear algebra, optimization, probability, etc...) with some algorithms discussed. It's a wonderful book and the authors are graciously keeping the book free to access.
* [**Hastie, et al.**: Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) - Probably one of the most famous books on the subject. It can be a bit dense and is somewhat "out-of-date" in that it doesn't have modern takes/algorithms. But it deserves its rightful place in the pantheon and very happy it is freely available.
* [**Hardt & Recht**: Patterns, Predictions and Actions - A Story About Machine Learning](https://mlstory.org/pdf/patterns.pdf) - A newer book but very good with a great narrative. It is more up-to-date (including more modern takes on model complexity plots) and includes great sections on Causality.
* [**James, et al.**: An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) - You can download the pdf of the book from here. It is a more introductory but also more modern in terms of the techniques covered.
* [**Murphy, Kevin**: Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/Murphy_Machine_Learning.pdf) - Truly wonderful book. I enjoyed every section.
* [**Murphy, Kevin**: Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) - I've not yet read this, but have it pre-ordered AND just saw the pre-print is available. It looks as wonderful as the first (and cannot wait to see the NEW book in 2023!!!)
* [**Shalev-Schwartz & Ben-David**: Understanding Machine Learning - From Theory to Algorithms ](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/w~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf) - A more theoretical book that is not for beginners but very good.
* [**Theodoridis & Koutroumbas**: Pattern Recognition](https://darmanto.akakom.ac.id/pengenalanpola/Pattern%20Recognition%204th%20Ed.%20(2009).pdf) - I just discovered this looking for a different book by Theodoridis. It looks similar (which is great) but additional topics. It is older and I've not read it yet.

### Subject Specific Books
* [**Goodfellow et al.**: Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - A really cool resource focussed just on deep learning.
* [**Rasmussen & Williams**: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf) - An amazing book about one of my favorite algorithms! It's short but wonderful. I can't recommend it enough.


### General Lectures
* [**Cornell**: CS 4/5780: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2021fa/) -  One of my all-time favorite series! Prof. Weinberger is brilliant and very funny.  
* [**The Mathematical Monk**: Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA) - Another fantastic introductory series. The speaker genuinely loves the subject and is very impressive as he proves/derives topics on the fly.  
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Statistical Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij2XCvrRzLokX6EoHWaGA2cC) - Pretty much everything from Uni Tübingen is worth a view. This is a bit more technical than the series by _Prof. Weinberger_ or _The Mathematical Monk_, but it is amazing.
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij1tHaOFY96m5uX3J21a6yNd) - Another beautiful series that is well-taught. It requires more background but well worth it!
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij1a6KdEy8PVE9zoCv6SlHRS) - Meant to provide the necessary basics to truly understand Machine Learning, such as Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics and many more topics.  Very well done. 
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij35ShKLDqccJSDntugY4FQT) - Similar in spirit to  _Prof. Weinberger_ and _The Mathematical Monk_. This is designed to get you up to speed and cover many important topics.  

### Subject Specific Lectures
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Deep Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij3NTWIdtMbfvX7Z-4WEXRqD) - This focusses only on deep learning but is fantastic and thorough.
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Data Compression with Probabilistic Deep Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij0Mp1dW2HuXlb-UQIYnv8xK) - To be honest, I've only begun to watch this series but it is good (as with all their content, but it is very intense.)
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij35L2MHGzis8AEHz7mg381_) - Again, very niche but it's amazing. I love this series!
* [**Uni Tübingen**: Self-Driving Cars](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05umP7R6ij321zzKXK6XCQXAaaYjQbzr) - I have not seen any of this but it's on my watchlist and I am certain it will be brilliant.
