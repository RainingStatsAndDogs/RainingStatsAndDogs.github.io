Summary: Nice to meet you all

I'm bad at these sorts of things under the best of circumstances--trying to figure out what to say in a blog is even worse. So I apologise for any awkwardness in advance and remember, **you were warned**! :) 

I am a professional data scientist with a mathematics & statistics background that has been in industry for quite a while. I am a lifelong learner and have benefited from having several wonderful teachers and mentors in my career. I hope that this blog in some small way repays the kindness I've received from so many wonderful people that took an interest in my development.  

I plan to cover several topics that I find interesting, including some past tutorials/talks I'd given, including things like: <br/>
* Statistical & Probabilistic Machine Learning
* Computer Vision
* Probability & Stochastic Processes
* Mathematical Statistics
* Bayesian Statistics
* Some general coding
* Whatever else sounds cool to me

Lastly, I hope that this also serves as a way to help me continue my path to learn more.  I am always interested in any feedback, cool links, etc...

If you made it this far, you must be a family member, so thank you above all for all your love and support. <3

### One last detail
I was able to cobble this together following two wonderful posts.  I'll hopefully make this a bit more streamlined but this only works because of these two great links:
[The First Great Link](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)
[The Second Great Link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/)
