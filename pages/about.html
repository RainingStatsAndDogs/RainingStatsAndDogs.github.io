    <p>I'm bad at these sorts of things under the best of circumstances--trying to figure out what to say in a blog is even worse. So I apologise for any awkwardness in advance and remember, <strong>you were warned</strong>! :) </p>
<p>I am a professional data scientist with a mathematics &amp; statistics background that has been in industry for quite a while. I am a lifelong learner and have benefited from having several wonderful teachers and mentors in my career. I hope that this blog in some small way repays the kindness I've received from so many wonderful people that took an interest in my development.  </p>
<p>I plan to cover several topics that I find interesting, including some past tutorials/talks I'd given, including things like:
* Statistical &amp; Probabilistic Machine Learning
* Computer Vision
* Probability &amp; Stochastic Processes
* Mathematical Statistics
* Bayesian Statistics
* Some general coding
* Whatever else sounds cool to me</p>
<p>Lastly, I hope that this also serves as a way to help me continue my path to learn more.  I am always interested in any feedback, cool links, etc...</p>
<p>If you made it this far, you must be a family member, so thank you above all for all your love and support. &lt;3</p>
<h3>One last detail</h3>
<p>I was able to cobble this together following two wonderful posts.  I'll hopefully make this a bit more streamlined but this only works because of these two great links:
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python">The First Great Link</a>
<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-setup-a-data-science-blog/">The Second Great Link</a></p>
