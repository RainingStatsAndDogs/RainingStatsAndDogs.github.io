    <h2>About</h2>
<p>There are some amazing free resources out there for everyone to use and I'll do my best to keep this list up-to-date. This is a WIP so expect lots of updates on this over time. </p>
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<h3>General Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dl.matlabyar.com/siavash/ML/Book/Ethem%20Alpaydin-Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning-The%20MIT%20Press%20(2014).pdf"><strong>Alpaydim, Ethem</strong>: Introduction to Machine Learning</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf"><strong>Barber, David</strong>: Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning</a> - Another of my all-time favorites. It's a fantastic book with excellent exposition.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf"><strong>Bishop, Christopher M.</strong>: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a> - And "older" book but very wonderfully put together with a great style to it. I'd highly recommend reading this.</li>
<li><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/"><strong>Diesenroth et al.</strong>: Mathematics for Machine Learning</a> - A really great book going through the required math for modern ML (linear algebra, optimization, probability, etc...) with some algorithms discussed. It's a wonderful book and the authors are graciously keeping the book free to access.</li>
<li><a href="https://stat206-winter21-01.courses.soe.ucsc.edu/system/files/attachments/efron-hastie-2016.pdf"><strong>Effron &amp; Hastie</strong>: Computer-Age Statistical Inference</a> - I struggled where this book lived as it covers lots of statistical concepts (e.g. Empirical Bayes, False Discovery Rates) but it <em>does</em> cover more modern ML approaches like tree ensembles and neural networks. What I can say is that this book is one of my all-time favorites and a should be required reading.</li>
<li><a href="https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/"><strong>Hastie, et al.</strong>: Elements of Statistical Learning</a> - Probably one of the most famous books on the subject. It can be a bit dense and is somewhat "out-of-date" in that it doesn't have modern takes/algorithms. But it deserves its rightful place in the pantheon and very happy it is freely available.</li>
<li><a href="https://mlstory.org/pdf/patterns.pdf"><strong>Hardt &amp; Recht</strong>: Patterns, Predictions and Actions - A Story About Machine Learning</a> - A newer book but very good with a great narrative. It is more up-to-date (including more modern takes on model complexity plots) and includes great sections on Causality.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statlearning.com/"><strong>James, et al.</strong>: An Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> - You can download the pdf of the book from here. It is a more introductory but also more modern in terms of the techniques covered.</li>
<li><a href="http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228/Murphy_Machine_Learning.pdf"><strong>Murphy, Kevin</strong>: Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective</a> - Truly wonderful book. I enjoyed every section.</li>
<li><a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html"><strong>Murphy, Kevin</strong>: Probabilistic Machine Learning</a> - I've not yet read this, but have it pre-ordered AND just saw the pre-print is available. It looks as wonderful as the first (and cannot wait to see the NEW book in 2023!!!)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/w~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf"><strong>Shalev-Schwartz &amp; Ben-David</strong>: Understanding Machine Learning - From Theory to Algorithms </a> - A more theoretical book that is not for beginners but very good.</li>
<li><a href="https://darmanto.akakom.ac.id/pengenalanpola/Pattern%20Recognition%204th%20Ed.%20(2009).pdf"><strong>Theodoridis &amp; Koutroumbas</strong>: Pattern Recognition</a> - I just discovered this looking for a different book by Theodoridis. It looks similar (which is great) but additional topics. It is older and I've not read it yet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Subject Specific Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/"><strong>Goodfellow et al.</strong>: Deep Learning</a> - A really cool resource focussed just on deep learning.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf"><strong>Rasmussen &amp; Williams</strong>: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning</a> - An amazing book about one of my favorite algorithms! It's short but wonderful. I can't recommend it enough.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Probability &amp; Statistics</h2>
<h3>General Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/billingsley.pdf"><strong>Billingsley, Patrick</strong>: Probability and Measure</a> - One of the best books covering the topic of measure-theoretic probability. It is very technical and I would recommend having a background in Measure Theory before starting this.</li>
<li><a href="http://bio5495.wustl.edu/Probability/Readings/DeGroot4thEdition.pdf"><strong>DeGroot &amp; Schervish</strong>: Probability and Statistics</a> - A great introductory book that starts with a basis in probability before moving into some statistics concepts. Best for those wanting self-study, there is a <a href="http://www.ru.ac.bd/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/03/101_05_DeGroot_Solutions-Manual-for-Probability-and-Statistics-2012.pdf">solutions manual</a> online.</li>
<li><a href="https://cis.temple.edu/~latecki/Courses/CIS2033-Spring13/Modern_intro_probability_statistics_Dekking05.pdf"><strong>Dekking et al.</strong>: A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics</a> - I've not read this, but perused the topics and it looks very good.</li>
<li><a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf"><strong>Durrett, Rick</strong>: Probability: Theory and Examples</a> - A measure-theoretic approach to probability. It's a classic but I wouldn't recommend this as your first book in the subject.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.probabilitycourse.com/"><strong>Pishro-Nik, Hossein </strong>:</a> - Available online with an interactive layout, there are lots of examples and proofs. Great book to starts learning the topics</li>
<li><a href="https://www.usb.ac.ir/FileStaff/9145_2018-9-18-12-59-30.pdf"><strong>Resnick, Sidney I.</strong>: A Probability Path</a> - Written by the wonderful Prof. Resnick, this book also provides a great introduction to measure-theoretic probability.

<li><a href="http://egrcc.github.io/docs/math/all-of-statistics.pdf"><strong>Wasserman, Larry</strong>: All of Statistics</a> - A fantastic book that covers tons of topics from Probability, Causal Inference, Linear Models and many more. Well-written.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Subject Specific Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mim.ac.mw/books/Mathematical%20statistics,%20basic%20ideas%20and%20selected%20topics%20Vol%201,%20Second%20Edition.pdf"><strong>Bickel &amp; Doksum</strong>: Mathematical Statistics - Basic Ideas and Selected Topics Vol. 1</a> - I'll be honest, I HATE this book. I'm including this because it covers lots of important topics. I personally found the writing poor and scattered and ideas are not well-covered. But I know lots of other universities still use this, so I'm probably in the minority. But <em>caveat emptor</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://mybiostats.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/casella-berger.pdf"><strong>Casella &amp; Berger</strong>: Statistical Inference</a> - This classic covers lots of generic probability methods (pretty much avoiding measure theory) and lots of statistics. It has a <a href="http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~zhu/ams570/Solutions-Casella-Berger.pdf">complete solutions manual</a> which is great for self-study.</li>
<li><a href="http://barbra-coco.dyndns.org/yuri/plan_answers_to_complex_question.pdf"><strong>Christensen, Ronald</strong>: Plane Answers to Complex Questions</a> - Focussed solely on Linear Models, this is a great book that covers Linear Algebra and then dives into a Linear Algebra-based approach to GLM's.</li>
<li><a href="http://213.230.96.51:8090/files/ebooks/Matematika/Efron%20B.%20Large-Scale%20Inference..%20Empirical%20Bayes%20Methods%20for%20Estimation,%20Testing,%20and%20Prediction%20(CUP,%202010)(ISBN%209780521192491)(O)(277s)%20MVsa%20.pdf"><strong>Efron, Bradley</strong>: Large Scale Inference - Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing &amp; Inference</a> - A great book covering Empirical Bayes with lots of fantastic applications.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf"><strong>Gelman et al.</strong>: Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA3)</a> - The Bayesian "Bible"! The principle text written by several amazing professors. It is a bit technical but AMAZING.</li>
<li><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/01/27/regression-and-other-stories-free-pdf/"><strong>Gelman et al.</strong>: Regression and Other Stories</a> - I'm a firm believer that Linear Models are highly powerful when used appropriately, but that is a skill that has been de-emphasized in favor of flashy approaches. This book covers tons of excellent topics, including Causal Inference and Bayesian Approaches. A MUST read.</li>
<li><a href="https://djsaunde.github.io/read/books/pdfs/probabilistic%20graphical%20models.pdf"><strong>Koller &amp; Friedman</strong>: Probabilistic Graphical Models - Principles and Techniques</a> - A fantastic textbook covering PGM's!

<li><a href="http://civil.colorado.edu/~balajir/CVEN6833/bayes-resources/RM-StatRethink-Bayes.pdf"><strong>McElreath, Richard</strong>: Statistical Rethinking</a> - A really great book on Bayesian probability that has a really unique perspective. The author is an evolutionary anthropologist and his perspective was very "fresh" in my opinion. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.fcfm.buap.mx/jzacarias/cursos/procesos/libros/book3pe.pdf"><strong>Resnick, Sidney I.</strong>: Adventures in Stochastic Processes</a> - Prof. Resnick's other book, this covers the misadventures of <em>Happy Harry</em> as a way to teach Stochastic Processes. Prof. Resnick is a treasure and I can't tell you how much I loved this book. Very accessible and funny. </li>
<li><a href="https://bayanbox.ir/view/7776870545953264619/introduction-to-probability-model-S.Ross-math-cs.blog.ir.pdf"><strong>Ross, Sheldon</strong>: An Introduction to Probability Models</a> - Another wonderfully accessible book into stochastic models. Covers Poisson Processes, Brownian Motion, Markov Chains, etc... </li>
<li><a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.pdf"><strong>Vershynin, Roman</strong>: High Dimensional Probability - An Introdution with Applications in Data Science</a> - The book focuses exclusively on high-dimensional probability, i.e. $\vec{\mathbf{x}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ where $n$ is very large. This is typically the case in actual DS/ML projects and requires specific results. You need a strong mathematical background for this.</li>
